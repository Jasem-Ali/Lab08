        Software engineering is a field of Computer science, for planning and composing projects for computers or other
        electronic gadgets. A software engineer designs a software utilizing techniques that bring about a noticeable
        improvement quality. Better quality programming is user-friendly, simplifies the code to comprehend, to
        maintain, easy to include new versions, dependable, effective and fulfil all the necessities that clients have
        characterized for them. It is significant due to effect of large expensive software systems and the role of
        software in safety-critical applications. It coordinates noteworthy math, software engineering and practices
        whose starting points are in designing. Review articles are the summary of current state of understanding on a
        particular research topic. They analyse or discuss research previously published by scientist and academicians
        rather than reporting novel research results. Review article comes in the form of systematic reviews and
        literature reviews and are a form of secondary literature. Systematic reviews determine an objective list of
        criteria, and find all previously published original research papers that meet the criteria. They then compare
        the results presented in these papers. Literature reviews, by contrast, provide a summary of what the authors
        believe are the best and most relevant prior publications. The concept of "review article" is separate from the
        concept of peer-reviewed literature. It is possible for a review to be peer-reviewed, and it is possible for a
        review to be non-peer-reviewed. The Journal of Computer Science & Systems Biology includes a wide range of
        fields in its discipline to create a platform for the authors to make their contribution in the form of review,
        research, mini-review, short communication etc towards the journal and the editorial office promises a peer
        review process for the submitted manuscripts for the quality of publishing.
